### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

One of my favorite labs performed throughout the semester was interestingly enough the first lab we had done. It was very simple and very basic, however it was my very first one. It’s special to me because every bit of code that I type was inspired by this little piece that started it all.

* Lab 12

Lab 12 Part 1 was one of my absolute favorites for two main reasons. The first of which being that it was to me the most difficult assignment we were given and it was fun to deconstruct a unique task. And the second reason being that it was the first piece of relatively “visible” code. By that I mean we made our first image, not only an image however, it was a colorful gif.

* Lab 3

Lab 3 Part 1 was a notable one for me not so much due to the content, but rather the people I would work with. For the duration of the Lab 3 Pizza Assignment, I was shown many tactics in code that I hadn’t seen before, or other ways to work around unique issues. It was also crucial to my basic understanding of terms such as int, double and void.
